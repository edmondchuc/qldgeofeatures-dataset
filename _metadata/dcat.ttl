  dcterms:description """This is a Linked Data dataset (i.e. online in HTML & RDF, according to LD principles) of the Geological Features of Interest of Queensland.

The foundation of this dataset was sourced from the Structural Framework data in Queensland GeoResGlobe (https://georesglobe.information.qld.gov.au/), and has been modified and revised therefrom. This has embraced updating the chronostratigraphic 'ages' of units/features, better delineation of the relationships between them, and the addition of units/features that had not been previously included (and for which spatial data may be presently wanting). Such revision and amendment, and the addition of other sorts of Geo Feature Types, will be an ongoing process.

This tool uses the SWEET Geological Features Profile Ontology (https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/sweet-geological-features-profile-ont) as its main data model and that model conforms to the Location Index (LocI) project's requirements so this information is compatible with other spatial data published by LocI."""@en ;
